# HTML Part 2

## List elements

Unordered list with "li" elements (list element):

- Bullet point style

``` html
<ul>
  <li> Milk <li>
  <li> Flour <li>
  <li> Eggs <li>
</ul>
```

Ordered list:

- Numbered style list

``` html
<ol>
  <li> Milk <li>
  <li> Flour <li>
  <li> Eggs <li>
</ol>
```

## Nesting and Identation

Nesting in list elements allows for identation and different list styles to come into play when html is rendered.

This way sublists are created within an already established list.

## Anchor elements

This "a" elements help creating hyperlinks within a website. In anchor tag, the href attribute is where the text will redirect if clicked.

There are other attributes called global attributes, which work in every html tag.

## Image elements

In the img tag, the source is the attribute that states the location of where the image is.

``` html
<img src="url"/>
```

Use [picsum](https://picsum.photos/200) for random image of 200 by 200 pixels.

``` html
<img src="url" alt="description"/>
```

The alt attribute is important to create and design inclusive website for impaired users.
